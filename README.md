# FlappyBallV2

This is a python remake of the classic game Flappy Bird. This is a remake of a project that I made during my A level studies for the NEA project. The reason I have decided to remake this, is to consolidate my knowlegde of inheritance in the form of making a rule based AI to play the game.

## To do:

* Turn the code from a single file to multiple files.
* Design a better UI to start the game.
* Create the AI class and the code for the AI to play the game.
